UPDATE 3: other second part of the code will hopefully be uploaded by this morning. It is getting delayed due to slow connection.
Link for the same will be uploaded accordingly.

UPDATE 2: this is the link for one of the three codes used...
https://github.com/anirudh28/lazyRemote
I am sorry for making new repository every time for all three codes.
I was unable to pull them in a single repo.(I don't know why that's happening, but it throws an error while doing so)
I will upload other two parts as soon as possible.



UPDATE 1 (FOR CIC): Last Updated: 14/04/2017 8:14PM IST
seems like theres some error while uploading our project...i will upload as early as possible(hopefully before 1am)....


AR BASED HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM FOR LAZY...
1) Use phone's camera and point it out towards any electronic appliance
2) The appliance would be connected to a small hardware computer such as 'ARDUINO' or 'RASBERRY PI'
3) Various controllable appliances would be highligted in your camera by a box(similar to face tracking)'
4) Information through wireless or bluetooth transfer would be sent to arduino
5) Arduino will further be attached to your home mains mcb's (this is the place where wires from all components go through)
6) Arduino and combination of heavy transistors or relay circuit will turn the device ON or OFF.

all wireless can be turned on or off even without use of camera by pre-registering electrical components and creating buttons in an application to turn off or on any appliance throughout the home.
