AR BASED HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM FOR LAZY...
1) Use phone's camera and point it out towards any electronic appliance
2) The appliance would be connected to a small hardware computer such as 'ARDUINO' or 'RASBERRY PI'
3) Various controllable appliances would be highligted in your camera by a box(similar to face tracking)'
4) Information through wireless or bluetooth transfer would be sent to arduino
5) Arduino will further be attached to your home mains mcb's (this is the place where wires from all components go through)
6) Arduino and combination of heavy transistors or relay circuit will turn the device ON or OFF.

all wireless can be turned on or off even without use of camera by pre-registering electrical components and creating buttons in an application to turn off or on any appliance throughout the home.
