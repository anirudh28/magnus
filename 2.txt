What all have we done?

Overall our basic idea works :) Successfully with no errors/exceptions.
1) You can now use the app to control the LED's/Appliances at your place
2) AR works shockingly well
3) Arduino easily controls the appliances using serial ports.

Whats next? 
1) Making the objects (appliances look better), 
2)have some design and sexy feel
3) Display more appliances(not really needed though)
